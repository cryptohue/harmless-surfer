# HarmLess Surfer
HarmLess surfer is the first application of the HarmLess series.
The aim of these applications is for low-spec pc/laptop users to be able to run simple applications such as web browsers and office applications. This browser is built in Visual Basic using WebBrowser. It is partially based of an online YouTube tutorial as well because i suck at coding.

Enjoy the app and please repotr any problems or feature suggestions in the "issues" section.
Tabs are being added in the next update.
